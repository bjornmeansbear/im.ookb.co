            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <p>Allison Margaret Pierce (born July 23, 1975) and Catherine Eleanor Pierce (born September 11, 1977) were born two years apart in Birmingham, Alabama. They 		             traveled frequently and received home-schooling from their self-described hippie parents. Their father played the guitar in various bands, while their mother was a painter.             exposed to music and arts at an early age, the Pierce sisters grew up listening to Joni Mitchell and Simon & Garfunkel. As children, they were encouraged to explore their            creative side and would perform at parties, weddings and churches. Allison started dancing at age three, and both sisters are accomplished ballerinas.</p>

          <h2>2000-2005</h2>
          <h3>The Pierces and Light of the Moon</h3>
          <p> It was while they attended Auburn University that a friend sent a tape to a record company in Nashville. This eventually resulted in their debut album The Pierces (2000). 	          It featured folk harmonies and adult alternative songs. In a 2004 interview, Allison Pierce commented that the album "sort of got lost in the shuffle".Allmusic attributes the          poor reception to "no label support".On August 10, 2005, their second album Light of the Moon was released through Universal. The album was produced by Brian Sperber and          featured 11 tracks that the Pierce sisters either wrote or co-wrote.</p>

    	<h2>2007â€“2010</h2>
        <h3>Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge</h3>
         <p> On March 20, 2007, their third album Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge was released in the U.S. Produced by Roger Greenawalt (Nils Lofgren, Radish, Ben Kweller), the album          has been well-reviewed, particularly for the single "Boring", which parodies celebrity socialites. The album has a darker, edgier style, at times using such diverse instruments          as an accordion, a calliope, bassoons, a sitar, violins, an autoharp, and a Hawaiian lap steel. It marks a definitive change in the direction of the band, which hitherto had          been known as a folk rock band. In an interview with Rolling Stone, after they were featured as a Rolling Stone Breaking Artist, they revealed that this album "felt like         [their]    last chance". As a result, they "just went for it, had fun".
         On October 24, 2007, The Pierces appeared on the CW television series Gossip Girl, in the episode "The Handmaiden's Tale", playing their songs "Secret" and "Three Wishes". They         made another in the episode Hi, Society, playing the same two songs.
         On August 21, 2008, "Secret" by The Pierces appeared in a promo for Showtime show Dexter.[6] In May 2009, Dutch TV channel NET 5 used "Secret" in a promo for their fantasy shows         Charmed and Ghost Whisperer. It also appears as the theme song for the ABC Family's original TV series, based upon the series of books by Sara Shepard, Pretty Little Liars.         Secret was also played over the closing credits in the movie "ExTerminators."
        The duo appeared in The All-American Rejects' third album, When The World Comes Down, in the track, "Another Heart Calls". They performed the song live with The All-American         Rejects in July 2009 at MySpace's The List in Dallas, Texas.
         The single "Secret", is the theme song of the TV-series Pretty Little Liars, it was suggested by one of the stars of the show, Ashley Benson. In 2012, the single "Secret" was        featured in a commercial for the Australian Big Brother.</p>

        later working on their homeland the US. They went on their

On January 3rd 2013, The Pierces tweeted a fan on twitter stating that their fifth studio album should be coming this year.Their song "We are stars" also was          featured on CW's Beauty and The Beast in episode 15 staring Jay Bunyan (Jay Ryan) and Kristin Kreuk.</p>
